            <h3>About EISJ</h3>
            <p>Established in 1991, EIS-Jumeirah is a community service of the Al Habtoor Group. The school provides the highest quality international education for more than 2100 students from Early Years to Year 13. The school was the first in Dubai to offer the International Baccalaureate (IB) Diploma Programme having received IB authorization as an "IB World School" in 1992. For over 20 years, our results in the Diploma Program have been some of the highest in the region. We are now one of a select group of schools that are authorised to offer all 4 IB programs: the PYP, MYP, DP and the CP.
            We are an international school welcoming students from over 80 different countries around the world into our IB programmes. Our international staff, many of whom are recognised IB Educators being workshop leaders or examiners, embrace the IB philosophy across our teaching and our interactions with each other. The school leadership team comprises international educators and administrators who share a common passion for teaching and learning. Together with the school's Director, we share an exciting vision for the school and promote excellence for all students across the campus.
